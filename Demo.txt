Hi Shirish,  
I am willing to work from the Mumbai office location, as mentioned in my offer letter. However, due to my responsibility to care for my parents, relocating is not feasible for me at the moment. I would like to kindly request that I be allowed to work from the Mumbai location or be assigned to a project without ODC restrictions, so I can continue working from my base location.
