### 1. Key Not Found Error

**Definition**: A "Key Not Found" error typically occurs in programming when an attempt is made to access a dictionary or map with a key that does not exist. 

**Context**: 
- **Python**: In Python, this error is usually raised as a `KeyError`. It happens when you try to access a key in a dictionary that is not present.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
  print(my_dict["c"])  # Raises KeyError: 'c'
  ```

**Handling**:
- **Using `get()` Method**: To avoid this error, you can use the `get()` method, which allows you to specify a default value if the key is not found.
  ```python
  value = my_dict.get("c", "default_value")
  ```

### 2. 404 Error

**Definition**: A `404 Not Found` error is an HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

**Context**: 
- **Web Development**: This error is common on the web when a user tries to access a URL that does not correspond to any resource on the server.
- **Example**: Trying to visit a page that has been removed or never existed.
- **Example Message**: 
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
  Content-Type: text/html
  Content-Length: 1234
  ```

**Handling**:
- **Server Configuration**: Ensure that the URL is correct and that the resource exists. Proper server-side configuration can also help handle these errors gracefully, often by providing a custom "404 Not Found" page.

### 3. List Index Out of Range

**Definition**: A "List Index Out of Range" error occurs when trying to access an index in a list that is outside its valid range of indices.

**Context**:
- **Python**: This error is typically raised as an `IndexError` in Python. It happens when the index is either negative or exceeds the size of the list.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3]
  print(my_list[3])  # Raises IndexError: list index out of range
  ```

**Handling**:
- **Check List Length**: Ensure that you are accessing indices within the range of the list. Use conditional statements or exception handling to avoid this error.
  ```python
  index = 3
  if index < len(my_list):
      print(my_list[index])
  else:
      print("Index out of range")
  ```
